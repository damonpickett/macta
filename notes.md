## Here are a few suggestions for how you can improve your app:

Consider adding error handling to your code. This can help to prevent errors from occurring and provide users with more helpful error messages if something goes wrong. You can use try-catch blocks to catch and handle errors, or you can use the .catch() method of a Promise to handle errors.

You may want to consider adding additional functionality to your app. For example, you could allow users to specify the model that they want to use for text completion, or you could provide options for adjusting the temperature or the number of tokens generated.

You could also consider adding a user interface to your app, such as a command-line interface or a graphical user interface. This would make it easier for users to interact with your app and provide a more user-friendly experience.

You may want to consider adding more context to the prompts that are sent to the OpenAI API. For example, you could include information about the user's operating system or the specific task that they are trying to perform. This could help the API to generate more relevant and accurate responses.

Finally, you may want to consider adding more robust documentation to your app. This could include a detailed README file with instructions on how to install and use the app, as well as detailed comments in the code explaining how it works.

I hope these suggestions are helpful! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you need more information.

## Here are a few suggestions for how you can test your app for its ability to generate adequate responses:

Test the app with a variety of different prompts and tasks to ensure that it is able to generate a wide range of responses. This could include tasks that are simple and straightforward, as well as tasks that are more complex or specific.

Consider testing the app with different models and temperature settings to see how the responses vary. You can use the model and temperature options in the createCompletion() method to specify the model and temperature that you want to use.

Test the app with prompts that contain typos or other errors to see how it handles these situations. This will help to ensure that the app is robust and can handle unexpected input.

Consider testing the app with different input sizes and lengths to see how it performs with longer or shorter prompts. This will help to ensure that the app is able to handle a wide range of input sizes.

Finally, you may want to consider testing the app with users who are unfamiliar with terminal commands to see how well it is able to provide clear and concise instructions. This will help to ensure that the app is able to provide helpful responses to users of all skill levels.

I hope these suggestions are helpful! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you need more information.

## Here are a few examples of MacOS terminal commands that you could test this program with:

"navigate the filesystem"
"create a new directory"
"copy files"
"rename a file"
"view the contents of a file"
"search for a file"
"install a package using Homebrew"
"download a file from a website"
"set an environment variable"
"compress or decompress a file"

Keep in mind that the generated response will depend on the model and prompt being used, so the generated text may vary.

## Here's an example of how you could test your error handling code when encountering a 503 error using the method 3 that I described:

```js
let retryCount = 0;
const retryLimit = 5;

const test503Error = () => {
    throw new Error("503");
}

const { Configuration, OpenAIApi } = require("openai");
const readline = require ('readline');
const dotenv = require('dotenv');
dotenv.config();

const configuration = new Configuration({
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});

const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);

const rl = readline.createInterface({
    input: process.stdin,
    output: process.stdout
});

rl.question(`Please describe the task you'd like to perform: `, async (task) => {
    while (retryCount <= retryLimit) {
        try {
            test503Error();
            // openai text completion function goes here
            const completion = await openai.createCompletion({
                prompt: `How do I ${task} in MacOS terminal? Please provide instruction with an example.`,
                temperature: 0.5,
                model: "text-davinci-002",
                max_tokens: 250,
                temperature: 0.5
            });

            completionOutput = completion.data.choices.pop();

            const text = completionOutput.text;

            console.log(text);
            break;
        } catch (err) {
            if(err.message == "503"){
                err.statusCode = 503;
                console.log(`503 error occurred, retry: ${retryCount} of ${retryLimit}`);
                retryCount++;
                continue;
            } else {
                console.log(`An error occurred: ${err}`);
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    rl.close();
});
```

App prompts user for api key then closes
I need app to prompt user for API key, check it, then prompt user for query OR tell user API key is invalid

## Jan 21 2023

Here's the logic I think the app should follow. When the user calls for the program within his/her terminal:

1. The program checks the config.json file for an api key
2. If there is more than 0 characters in the apikey value, the program proceeds to prompt the user for their prompt. If there is nothing in the apikey value, the program prompts the user for their api key.
3. If the user has to enter their apikey, the program records the apikey in config.json file
4. Then prompts the user for their prompt.
4. If their apikey is invalid, then the program has them enter their apikey again.
